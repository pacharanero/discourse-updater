# for more details see the README.md from this repository
# RENAME THIS FILE TO discourses.yml TO USE IT
# list your discourses below using YAML 'Array' syntax,
# EXACTLY AS THEY ARE DEFINED IN YOUR SSH CONFIG FILE.
# YAML is very indentation sensitive so if in doubt use an online YAML checker.
# I advise not to check this file into version control, although the security risk is minimal.
